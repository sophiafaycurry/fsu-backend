# Fullstack University

Welcome to Fullstack University! Your team has been hired to build a web platform that will allow the university to manage its academic departments and faculty.

## Overview

You'll have a week to build this project from the ground up with your team. You should have two separate repositories: one for your frontend, and another for your backend. Your goal is to meet the requirements specified below.

There is nothing to submit in Canvas, but your team will be doing a brief 2 minute presentation to showcase your app on **Wednesday, July 23** at the beginning of class.

## Requirements

### As a visitor, I want to be able to:

- view a list of all departments
- view a single department so I can see more details, such as:
  - name, description, images, contact info
  - list of faculty in the department
- view a list of all faculty
- view a single professor so I can see more details, such as:
  - name, bio, profile image, contact info
  - department this professor belongs to
- register for and log into an administrator account
  - for the sake of simplicity, anyone can make an admin account!

### As a logged-in administrator, I want to be able to:

- add a new department
- remove an existing department
- change the name, description, or banner image of an existing department
- add or remove professors to/from an existing department
- add a new professor
- remove an existing professor
- change the name, email, bio, or profile image of an existing professor
- change the department an existing professor belongs to

## Milestones

While your team may tackle this project however you'd like, here are some suggested milestones to help guide your progress.

### Frontend

- Build a wireframe for the frontend, along with example user interactions
- Set up React Router with empty pages
- Pages to view all departments and all faculty (dummy data)
- Pages to view details of a single department and faculty (dummy data)
- Set up an API directory to pull real data in from the backend

### Backend

- Define a database schema that captures all the necessary information
- Seed the database with dummy data
- Build API routes to serve the data
- Build API routes to add/remove records
- Build API routes to update existing records

## Notes

### Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

To allow your frontend to communicate with your backend running on port 3000:

1. Tell your frontend to send requests to `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Install `cors` in your backend.
3. Add the cors middleware near the top of your `server.js`, which allows any requests coming from `localhost`:
   ```js
   const cors = require("cors");
   app.use(cors({ origin: /localhost/ }));
   ```
